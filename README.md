## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Be present (meditation app)
    - Includes different information / resources for a personâ€™s spiritual journey
    - A timer with a soothing alarm
    - Nice, calming music. Maybe include some voice overs for guided meditation?
This is my top choice so far. I will create a medititation app that provides resources and information for people who are wanting
to become more involved in their meditation journey. This is a mindfulness app that is a good starting point for beginners. It will
also include a timer app with some soothing music and guided meditation voice overs. The color scheme will be light and easy to look at.


- You learn everyday (keeping track of your goals and tracking process for something you are learning)
    - Set a goal for yourself that you are wanting to learn
    - Create a schedule for how much you are wanting to focus or practice on it
    - Log the progress through  a digital diary including images, pictures, and texts
    - Calendar included


- Life is a game (to do list app but a game)
    - List of tasks you need to complete with their significance
    - Depending on the rank of the significance, you get a specific number of points when the task is completed
    - Certain number of points moves you up arenas. Maybe the theme of the game can be nature based.
    - Calendar included



## Notes

Had trouble getting used to the UI of XCode, as well as step 3 of the prework when connecting the logic to the button.
